## Data collection
The original Place Pulse 2.0 dataset (http://pulse.media.mit.edu/data/) contains `111,390` image URLs and their `1,223,649` pairwise comparisons. When we download the images, some URLs are unavailable. We finally obtain `110,688` images and `1,208,808` pairwise comparisons, including `1,046,926` unequal ones and `161,882` equal ones.
